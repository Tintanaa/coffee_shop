### Usage:

The UI components in this directory are used to create the menu section of the Coffee Shop app. They provide a well-organized and efficient way to display and navigate through a list of categories and their respective products.

### Best Practices:

* Component Reusability: Each component is designed to be reusable, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
* State Management: The components utilize `StatefulWidget` when necessary, but the focus is on keeping state management local and specific to each component.
* Efficiency: The components are optimized for performance by using efficient Flutter widgets and techniques like `GridView.builder` and `ScrollablePositionedList`.
